## Web Archive

![showcase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-d-song/web-archive/main/docs/imgs/showcase.gif)

Web Archive is a free web archiving and sharing service based on Cloudflare, including the following parts:  

- Browser plugin: Save the webpage as a single html file and upload it to the server.
- Server: Receive the html file uploaded by the browser plugin and store it in the database and storage bucket.
- Web client: Query the html file and display it.

The server is based on the full set of services of Cloudflare Worker, including D1 database and R2 storage bucket.

## Why
Most web archiving tools, like archivebox, are based on server-side calls to headless browsers to capture pages.  
This approach has the following drawbacks:  
- It is difficult to archive websites that require login, such as zhihu and Medium, as they need to configure tokens or cookies.
- Headless browsers require higher server requirements, and most users are nas users.
Web Archive is a completely free and zero-threshold solution, and Cloudflare can easily migrate the data back to the local host after self-hosting.

## Feat & Roadmap
- [x] Folder classification
- [x] Page preview image
- [x] Title keyword search
- [x] Showcase, share the pages you captured
- [x] Mobile support
- [ ] Tag classification system
- [ ] Save the page as markdown

## Deploy Guide
Github Actions (Recommended)  

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ray-d-song/web-archive)  

Click the button above, follow the instructions of Cloudflare to complete the deployment.  
 
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> R2 storage bucket is a feature that needs to be manually enabled in the Cloudflare panel, please enable it before deployment or re-run Github Actions after failure.
> You only need to enable the R2 feature, no need to create a storage bucket, the storage bucket will be created automatically during deployment.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When creating a token, select the `Edit Cloudflare Workers` template directly, and then manually add the `D1 Edit` permission.

Once deployed, please login as soon as possible, the first user to login will be set as the administrator.

<summary>Command Deploy</summary>

Requires the local installation of the node environment.  
Updating during command deployment is more troublesome, it is recommended to use Github actions for deployment.  
### 0. Download the code
Download the latest service.zip from the release page, unzip it, and execute the following commands in the root directory.

### 1. Login
```bash
npx wrangler login
```

### 2. Create r2 bucket
```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create web-archive
```
Output:
```bash
 ⛅️ wrangler 3.78.10 (update available 3.80.4)
--------------------------------------------------------

Creating bucket web-archive with default storage class set to Standard.
Created bucket web-archive with default storage class set to Standard.
```

### 3. Create d1 database
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create web-archive
```

Output:

```bash
 ⛅️ wrangler 3.78.10 (update available 3.80.4)
--------------------------------------------------------

✅ Successfully created DB 'web-archive' in region UNKNOWN
Created your new D1 database.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.DB
database_name = "web-archive"
database_id = "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
```

Copy the last line of the output, and replace the `database_id` value in the `wrangler.toml` file.  

Then execute the initialization sql:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply web-archive --remote
```

Output:
